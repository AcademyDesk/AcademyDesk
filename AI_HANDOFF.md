# Academy Desk handoff

## Current state

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Project | Academy Desk |
| Product | AI-native SaaS operating platform for academies |
| Initial market | Music academies, with architecture capable of supporting other instructor-led academies such as dance and arts |
| Repository | `D:\AcademyDesk` |
| Accepted source of truth | GitHub |
| `main` | `f7af512f884ca5fe8ac3ddb287c852492592e709` until the Docker branch is reviewed |
| Active branch | `cursor/docker-runtime-validation` in `D:\AcademyDesk-cursor-docker` |
| Application baseline | `535e6784e38b20fa1c9486b889544706f3c454a7` |

## Tech stack

- Next.js frontend
- ASP.NET Core API
- EF Core
- SQL Server
- Docker
- Azure target deployment
- GitHub source control

## Baseline validation completed

The following checks passed at commit `535e6784e38b20fa1c9486b889544706f3c454a7`:

- .NET build passed
- 1,042 API tests passed
- TypeScript validation passed
- Dockerfile static validation passed
- QA parsing validation passed
- `git diff` checks passed
- staged secret scan passed

## ENTERPRISE TESTING IS NOT COMPLETE

The baseline above does not complete enterprise testing. Continue the existing testing program. Do not restart it from zero, and do not treat a later unit or API pass as a substitute for the remaining gates in `ENTERPRISE_TESTING_ROADMAP.md`.

Dockerfile static validation is not equivalent to:

- complete image builds
- container startup
- runtime validation
- database integration
- end-to-end integration

`QA/EVIDENCE` remains primarily local and is intentionally not broadly committed. Missing committed evidence files do not mean the underlying QA work is absent. Do not delete useful QA work because GitHub governance has been introduced.

Development seeder credentials were removed from current source. Local development values were rotated using secure local secrets. Do not reintroduce hard-coded credentials.

## DO NOT RESTART THE EXISTING TESTING PROGRAM

Continue from the existing baseline, QA work, tests, and evidence.

Start from these living records rather than inventing a replacement plan:

- `QA/00_QA_README.md`
- `QA/02_TEST_MASTER_PLAN.md`
- `QA/03_TEST_MATRIX.md`
- `QA/08_SECURITY_TEST_MATRIX.md`
- `QA/09_RELEASE_GATES.md`
- `QA/ISSUES/INDEX.md`
- `QA/REPORTS/`

Earlier QA checkpoints record their own historical counts and commits. Those records stay as history. The verified GitHub baseline for new work is `535e6784e38b20fa1c9486b889544706f3c454a7`.

## Current known work categories

- Authentication and security
- Authorization
- Role isolation
- Tenant and academy isolation
- Responsive UI
- Dropdown layering
- Dropdown positioning on scroll
- Mobile and null failures
- Time and clock standardization
- Layout and alignment
- Integration testing
- Transaction and concurrency testing
- Enterprise remediation

Known shared UI cases already tracked in QA include `UI-DROPDOWN-001`, `UI-SCROLL-001`, and `UI-TIME-001`, with issue records such as `BUG-UI-0001`. Open issues remain in `QA/ISSUES/INDEX.md`. Phase 2B repair reports in `QA/REPORTS/` are continuation points, not a closed release.

## Product direction in force

Academy Desk is evolving into an AI-native academy operating system on top of the existing deterministic platform. The current ERP, APIs, permissions, and business rules stay. Read `AI_PRODUCT_VISION.md` before changing product behaviour, architecture, UX, or AI functionality.

Azure deployment waits for the pre-Azure quality gate in `ENTERPRISE_TESTING_ROADMAP.md`. Do not deploy unless explicitly instructed.

## Active handoff

CURRENT PHASE: Docker image and container runtime validation.

COMPLETED: API image runtime, static-export web image runtime, web asset to test API URL, API to disposable SQL Server, startup migrations, bounded health, and the 1,042 API tests after the health change.

FIXES: The web image serves the Next static `out/` tree. `GET /health` returns 503 within about 5 seconds when SQL cannot be reached.

TEST RESULTS: See `QA/REPORTS/PHASE_DOCKER_RUNTIME_VALIDATION.md`. API tests 1042/1042 PASS. Web `/`, `/login`, and `/certificates` returned 200. Unreachable SQL health returned 503 in 5206 ms.

OPEN BLOCKERS: Enterprise release is not complete. Data-protection keys remain container-local. npm audit findings in the web image were not triaged. BUG-FUNC-0032 and the open P0 issues stay open.

NEXT SLICE: BUG-FUNC-0032 certificate PDF, layout, and linked full-portal coverage.

MODEL/TOOL ROUTING: This Docker remediation stayed on Grok 4.7 in Cursor. Next certificate slice stays on Cursor unless it needs Sol High.

BRANCH: `cursor/docker-runtime-validation`

COMMIT: This handoff is updated in the Docker remediation commit. Do not merge to `main`.

## Data Protection classification

The API container logs that data-protection keys are stored under `/root/.aspnet/DataProtection-Keys` and may be unencrypted. Those keys do not survive container replacement and are not shared by replicas. That is acceptable for this single-container QA run. Before Azure scale-out, production needs a persisted shared key ring. This slice does not add that ring.

Update this file after substantial work. Record the branch, commit, what changed, what was validated, what remains open, and the next route.
